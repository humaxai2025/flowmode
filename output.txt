📵 Blocking distracting websites...
Created hosts file backup at user_hosts.backup

📋 FlowMode is using a user-level hosts file for website blocking.
   Location: C:\Users\Sriram\.flowmode\hosts

   For full website blocking effectiveness, you may want to:
   • Configure your DNS server to use this file as an additional hosts source
   • Or copy the contents to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (requires admin)
   • Use browser extensions for additional blocking
   • FlowMode will still provide focus tools and app blocking without admin rights
